# CNN-Model-Development
Developing and analyzing the performance of various CNN Models

In this project, I explore the impacts of varying CNN modeling techniques including varying architectures, Optimizers, Data Augmentation methods and more.

Firstly, I've created a data processing pipeline, allowing for quick and tidy loading of cleaned data within the model analysis notebook. 

DISCLAIMER: This project is ongoing and therefore missing models and other key functions.
